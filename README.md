# React Router Dom v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using nested routes in React Router Dom v6.  The problem involves nested routes failing to render correctly, often displaying a blank page or the default route instead of the expected nested component. This is a concise example to help illustrate the problem and offer a solution.

## Problem
The provided `App.js` demonstrates a setup where nested routes are defined but don't render as expected in React Router v6.  The issue can stem from various factors, such as incorrect path definitions or unexpected behavior of the router.

## Solution
The `AppSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the code, addressing the rendering issue. This often requires careful review of route path definitions and potentially adjustments to how the routes are structured within your React application to ensure correct component rendering.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory using the command line.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the unexpected behavior in the original `App.js` and the correct rendering in `AppSolution.js`.
